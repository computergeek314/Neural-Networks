		<h2>Welcome!</h2>

			Welcome to my personal website! I am Benjamin Jones, a Mathematics major at ASU who enjoys doing computer science in his free time. Over the past couple of years I have created many projects, most of which are posted on my <a href = "https://github.com/been-jamming" target = "_blank">github account</a>. My favorite projects involve a combination of math and computer science, and they emphasize functional intricacy as well as performance. Some examples of such projects include my Apple 1 emulator, terminal rubik's cube, and my B compiler. Head over to the projects tab to check them out!
