			This is an Apple 1 Emulator that runs in a terminal. Unfortunately, due to copyright issues, it does not provide the ROMs needed to run the emulator. The original Apple 1 had a dummy hardware terminal which was only capable of displaying text, which means that all of the original features can be emulated in an ordinary terminal. The Apple 1 ran on a 6502 processor with 4KB of RAM by default, which could be expanded to 8 KB. Customers could also buy a cassette interface which came with the Apple 1 BASIC ROM loaded at address 0xE000. In the video above you see me starting Apple 1 Basic. The cassette interface allowed you to load and store programs made in Apple 1 BASIC. This cassette interface is also emulated, and cassettes are stored as files.
